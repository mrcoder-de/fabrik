# Autotranslation with Deepl

I'm using the [Deepl](https://www.deepl.com) API to automatically translate the fabric prompts to German.

If you want to run the translation yourself, please checkout `tranlate.py`. Use the top level of this
project as the working directory.

# Cleanup

I wrote the `cleanup.py` script for cleaning up while I was testing. Maybe you'll find it handy.
